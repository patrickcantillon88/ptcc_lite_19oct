#### Via Python (Direct)
```python
from backend.agents.educational import DifferentiationSpecialistAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = DifferentiationSpecialistAgent()

# Create learner profiles
student_data = [
    {
        'id': 'student_001',
        'grade_level': '5th Grade',
        'performance_level': 'below',
        'learning_styles': ['visual', 'kinesthetic'],
        'accommodations': ['extended time'],
        'ell_level': 'Intermediate'
    },
    {
        'id': 'student_002',
        'grade_level': '5th Grade',
        'performance_level': 'at',
        'learning_styles': ['auditory'],
        'accommodations': []
    }
    # ... more students
]

profiles = await agent.create_learner_profiles(student_data)

# Generate differentiated content
diff_content = await agent.differentiate_content(
    lesson_topic="Photosynthesis",
    grade_level="5th Grade",
    subject="Science",
    learner_profiles=profiles,
    num_tiers=4
)

# Export in different formats

json_str = diff_content.to_json()
lesson_plan = diff_content.to_lesson_plan()

# Access specific parts
print(f"Tiers: {len(diff_content.content_tiers)}")
print(f"UDL Principles: {len(diff_content.udl_principles)}")
print(f"Accommodations: {len(diff_content.accommodations)}")
