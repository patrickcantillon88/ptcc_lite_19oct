## Filesystem Changes (Last 24 Hours)
- Top-level docs/scripts updated: a large set including FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md, PHASE_2_COMPONENTS_CREATED.md, AI_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md, WARP.md, USER_GUIDE.md, ENHANCEMENT_PLAN_2025-10-17.md, DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md, SYSTEM_READY_FOR_LAUNCH.txt, PHASE3_TESTING_GUIDE.md, DEMO_SETUP.md, PHASE_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md, Dockerfile, PHASE_3_KICKOFF.md, SECURE_DEMO_OPTIONS.md, PRE_STARTUP_BUG_REPORT.md, PHASE_3_ISSUES_LOG.md, PTCC_COLLEAGUE_PROPOSAL.md, DOCKER_README.md, DATA_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md, PHASE3_AGENTS_SUMMARY.md, FAST_LAUNCHER.md, FINAL_CONSISTENCY_REPORT.md, PHASE3_QUICKSTART.md, PTCC_Updated_Document.md, DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md, PROJECT_ISSUES_AND_RISKS.md, DATASET_CONFIG.md, DEPLOYMENT_PROPOSAL_UPDATED.md, docker-compose.yml, PHASE3_AGENTS_READY.md, FRONTEND_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, STARTUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt, PRIVACY_SAFEGUARDING_SYSTEM.md, ADD_RAG_IMAGE.md, FRONTEND_FILES_CREATED.txt, LANDING_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md, STARTUP_GUIDE.md, start-ptcc.sh, start-ptcc-safe.sh, start-ptcc-fast.sh, .dockerignore
- Logs updated: .ptcc_logs/*, backend/logs/ptcc.log, logs/ptcc.log
- Frontend (multiple apps) updated: classroom-tools, at-risk-students, progress-* modules, seating-chart, performance-trends, cca-comments, group-formation, behaviour-management, intervention-priority, documentation-app, quiz-upload, project-guardian/src, assessment-analytics-overview, differentiation, shared
- Mobile PWA updated: frontend/mobile-pwa/dist/*, frontend/mobile-pwa/src/*, vite config, package-lock.json
- Desktop (Streamlit) touched: frontend/desktop-web/app.py, real_schedule_data.py, navigation.py, pages/02_ü§ñ_classroom_copilot.py
- Backend updated: core modules (config, base_agent, llm_integration), models (database_models.py, student.py), API routers (agents/*, api/*.py), main.py, migrations and ingestion scripts
- Data files updated: backend/data/chroma/chroma.sqlite3, backend/data/school.db, data/school.db
- Utility scripts updated: scripts/simplified_migration.py, backend/scripts/*, import_pdf_students.py

## Key Highlights
- Backend: Significant edits across core (config/LLM/RAG), models, and API routers; new/renamed agent infrastructure; main app touched.
- Frontend: Streamlit dashboard updates; Mobile PWA code and build outputs updated; multiple React mini-apps/components refreshed.
- DevOps: New/updated Dockerfile, docker-compose, and start scripts (fast/safe/original launchers).
- Documentation: Extensive authoring of architectural, integration, performance, safeguarding, and phase checkpoint docs.
- Data/Vector Store: SQLite and Chroma data updated (likely due to ingestion or test runs).

## Risks / Considerations
- Large volume of untracked documentation and code may be accidental; decide which should be added to version control.
- Deleted router (backend/api/ict_behavior.py) requires verification of imports/references.
- Updated databases suggest local state changes; ensure migrations/scripts are repeatable for teammates.
- Generated artifacts (dist, logs, databases) should be gitignored if not already.

## Suggested Next Steps
1) Review and stage intended additions:
   - Add essential new routers/modules and curated docs.
   - Ensure .gitignore excludes build outputs, logs, and local databases as desired.
2) Run quality gates (lint, type-check, tests) and fix any breakages.
3) Make a single ‚ÄúMilestone Checkpoint‚Äù commit bundling today‚Äôs intended changes.
4) Cut a tag (e.g., v0.3.0-milestone) after the commit if appropriate.
5) Optional: move lengthy status docs into a docs/ folder and link from README.

## Appendices
- This checkpoint was generated by scanning git status (for working changes) and filesystem timestamps (last 24 hours) to approximate "today‚Äôs" activity.
