## Team Notes

### What Worked Well
- Clear test organization by component
- Comprehensive mock object usage
- Good error messages in tests
- Flexible assertions for complex types

### Lessons Learned
1. Keep test data aligned with production API contracts
2. Use consistent field naming across test and production code
3. Consider dataset sizes in performance tests
4. Document field requirements to prevent issues
5. Test both success and failure paths

### Recommendations
- Maintain test files as living documentation
- Update tests when API contracts change
- Run tests frequently in development cycle
- Use coverage reports to guide new tests
- Keep test maintenance documentation current
