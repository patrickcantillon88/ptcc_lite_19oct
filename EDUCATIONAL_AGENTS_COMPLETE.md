## 🎯 Ready for Use

All agents are production-ready and can be used:

### 1. Direct Python API
```python
from backend.agents.educational import (
    LessonPlanGeneratorAgent,
    AssessmentGeneratorAgent,
    FeedbackComposerAgent,
    DifferentiationSpecialistAgent
)

# Generate lesson plan
lesson_agent = LessonPlanGeneratorAgent()
lesson = await lesson_agent.generate_lesson_plan(
    topic="Photosynthesis",
    grade_level="5th Grade",
    subject="Science"
)

# Generate assessment
assessment_agent = AssessmentGeneratorAgent()
assessment = await assessment_agent.generate_assessment(
    topic="Photosynthesis",
    grade_level="5th Grade",
    question_count=10
)

# Compose feedback
feedback_agent = FeedbackComposerAgent()
report = await feedback_agent.compose_feedback(
    student_data={'name': 'Alex Chen', 'grade': '5th Grade'},
    assessment_results={
        'scores': {'math': 85, 'reading': 92},
        'participation': 'High',
        'effort': 'Consistent'
    }
)

# Differentiate content
diff_agent = DifferentiationSpecialistAgent()
profiles = await diff_agent.create_learner_profiles(student_data_list)
diff_content = await diff_agent.differentiate_content(
    lesson_topic="Photosynthesis",
    grade_level="5th Grade",
    subject="Science",
    learner_profiles=profiles
)
```

### 2. Agent Orchestrator
```python
from backend.core.agent_orchestrator import AgentOrchestrator

orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()

# Execute via orchestrator
result = await orchestrator.execute_task(
    agent_id="feedback_composer",
    task_type="compose_feedback",
    parameters={
        "student_data": {...},
        "assessment_results": {...}
    },
    user_id="teacher_123"
)
```

### 3. REST API Endpoints
```bash
# Lesson planning
POST /api/orchestration/quick/lesson-plan

# Assessment generation
POST /api/orchestration/quick/assessment

# Feedback composition (new capability!)
POST /api/orchestration/quick/feedback

# Content differentiation (new capability!)
POST /api/orchestration/quick/differentiate
```

### 4. Workflow System
```python
from backend.core.workflow_engine import WorkflowBuilder

# Create teaching workflow
workflow = (WorkflowBuilder("complete_teaching_cycle")
    .add_node("lesson_planner", "create_lesson")
    .add_node("differentiation_specialist", "differentiate_content")
    .add_node("assessment_generator", "create_assessment")
    .add_node("feedback_composer", "generate_feedback")
    .build()
)
```
