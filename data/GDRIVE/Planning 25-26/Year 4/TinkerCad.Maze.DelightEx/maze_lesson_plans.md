## Slide 2: Concept Explanation & Introduction
**Today's Focus:** Learning TinkerCAD Skills

**Key TinkerCAD Tools:**
- **Shapes Panel**: Where we find blocks, cylinders, and other 3D objects
- **Workplane**: The flat surface where we build (like a table)
- **Camera Controls**: Moving around to see our design from different angles
- **Resize Handles**: The white squares that let us change size
- **Group Tool**: Combines shapes into one object

**Remember:** We're building the frame first, then adding internal walls next lesson.

## Slide 3: Core Activity - Step-by-Step Instructions

- **Pathway Width**: Must be wide enough for a ball to roll through
- **Dead Ends**: Create some to add challenge
- **Clear Path**: Always have at least one route from start to finish

**Think About:** How will a ball move through your maze? What might stop it or slow it down?

## Slide 3: Core Activity - Step-by-Step Instructions
**Activity 1: Open and Review (5 mins)**
1. Open your maze project from last lesson
2. Check outer frame is still grouped and correct size
