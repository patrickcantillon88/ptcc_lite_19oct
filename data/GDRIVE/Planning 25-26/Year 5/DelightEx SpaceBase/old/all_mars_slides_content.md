**Title:** Lesson 1: Solar System Animation
**Subtitle:** Making planets move in space

## SLIDE 2 - LEARNING OBJECTIVES
**Title:** What We'll Learn Today

**Content:**
‚Ä¢ Make planets move in circles that never stop

‚Ä¢ Make close planets move faster than far planets

**Key Words:** Paths, Forever Loops, Parallel Processing

## SLIDE 3 - CODE STRUCTURE
**Title:** The Code We'll Use

**Content:**
```
when play clicked
run parallel
    forever
        move Earth on path earth_path forward in 10 sec
run parallel
    forever
        move Moon on path moon_path forward in 3 sec
```

**Steps to Build:**
1. Create circular paths for each planet
2. Close planets = shorter times, far planets = longer times
3. Use "run parallel" so all planets move together
