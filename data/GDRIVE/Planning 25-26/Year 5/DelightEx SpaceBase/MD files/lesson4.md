# LUNAR BASE RECONSTRUCTION
## Lesson 1: Reconstructing Your Base
**Year 5 - Age 10**

### Slide 1: Lesson Title
**LUNAR BASE RECONSTRUCTION**  
Lesson 1: Reconstructing Your Base  
Year 5 - Age 10

### Slide 2: Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Analyze a completed lunar base to understand how parts connect
- Build your own unique base layout using the starter components
- Position domes, tubes, and airlocks in logical places
- Add characters from the library to bring your base to life
- Make a character move around your base using code blocks

**Key Skills:** Spatial thinking, building with modules, basic animation

### Slide 3: Input - Teacher Shows Example
Look at this completed lunar base: [Teacher shows example base on screen]

**Notice:**
- Different colored domes connected by tubes
- Airlock doors at entrance points
- Characters placed throughout the base
- Logical flow between different areas

**Your Starter Kit Contains:**
- Domes (can be copied and recolored)
- Tube segments for corridors
- Airlock doors
- Button groups
- Pre-positioned camera

**You Need to Add:** Characters from the library!

### Slide 4: Core Task - All Students Start Building
**Follow These Steps:**
1. Study the example base - how are parts connected?
2. Start with one dome as your main living area
3. Add tube segments to create corridors
4. Connect more domes with logical pathways
5. Position airlock doors at entrance points
6. Place button groups near doors
7. Add characters from the library

**Use this code to make a character patrol:**
```
when program starts
   move Regular_man on path Round_path in 120 sec forever
   set gravity pull to 0.17
```

**Remember:** Your base doesn't have to match the example - make it your own!

### Slide 5: Mini Plenary
**Check Your Progress - Ask Yourself:**
- ‚úì Does your base have clear connections between areas?
- ‚úì Is your character moving continuously around part of the base?
- ‚úì Are your airlocks positioned at logical entry/exit points?
- ‚úì Can you identify the purpose of each dome in your design?
- ‚úì Did you successfully add characters from the library?

If you answered YES to most questions, you're ready for the next challenge!

### Slide 6: Foundation Challenge (LA)
#### BASIC 1-DOME BASE
**Your Mission:** Build a simple but functional lunar base for astronauts

**What You Need:**
- 1 dome as main habitat
- 1 airlock door at the entrance
- 1 character moving on the path

**Success Looks Like:**
- A secure main living area
- Clear entrance to the base
- One character patrolling around

**Perfect for:** Getting the basics right first!

### Slide 7: Intermediate Challenge (MA)
#### CONNECTED 2-DOME COMPLEX
**Your Mission:** Create a multi-area base with different purposes

**What You Need:**
- 2 domes with different functions (living, working)
- Tube segments connecting them
- 2 airlock doors for different entrances
- 2-3 characters placed around the base

**Success Looks Like:**
- Connected areas with logical flow
- Multiple entry points
- Characters in different locations

**Perfect for:** Building more complex structures!

### Slide 8: Advanced Challenge (HA)
#### MULTI-AREA 3-DOME NETWORK
**Your Mission:** Design a sophisticated lunar settlement

**What You Need:**
- 3+ specialized areas with unique colors
- Complex tube network connecting everything
- Strategic airlock placement
- Multiple characters with different roles
- Custom or modified patrol paths

**Success Looks Like:**
- Professional-quality design
- Innovative layout solutions
- Complex character interactions

**Perfect for:** Pushing your design skills to the limit!

### Slide 9: Plenary
**WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED TODAY:**
- üèóÔ∏è Built functional lunar bases from scratch
- üß† Used spatial reasoning and logical design thinking
- üöÄ Created realistic space habitats
- üë• Brought bases to life with moving characters

**KEY LEARNING:** You've proven that complex structures can be built from simple components - just like real space missions! Your bases show real engineering thinking!

### Slide 10: Next Steps
**YOU'RE READY FOR LESSON 2!**

**What's Coming Next:**
- üîò Make your buttons actually open and close doors
- ‚öñÔ∏è Add different gravity zones to your base areas
- üèÉ Program realistic character movement with physics
- üéÆ Create interactive systems that respond to clicks

**Your Challenge:** Keep your base safe - we'll be adding interactive systems next lesson!

**Well Done, Space Engineers!**
