# LUNAR BASE RECONSTRUCTION
## Lesson 2: Interactive Systems Programming
**Year 5 - Age 10**

### Slide 1: Lesson Title
**LUNAR BASE RECONSTRUCTION**  
Lesson 2: Interactive Systems Programming  
Year 5 - Age 10

### Slide 2: Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Program buttons to control doors using "when clicked" events
- Apply different gravity settings to simulate space zones
- Use "push with velocity" to create realistic character movement
- Make objects behave differently in low-gravity environments
- Create systems that respond to user interactions

**Key Skills:** Event programming, physics simulation, cause and effect

### Slide 3: Input - Teacher Shows Example
Watch this interactive base in action: [Teacher demonstrates clicking buttons to open doors]

**See How:**
- Buttons make doors open and close automatically
- Characters jump differently in low gravity
- Different areas have different gravity effects
- Systems respond immediately to clicks

**Building on Your Base:** Your reconstructed base from Lesson 1 is perfect for adding interactivity! We'll make those buttons and doors actually work like real space systems.

### Slide 4: Core Task - All Students Start Programming
**Essential Code Blocks to Use:**

**Door Control System:**
```
when ButtonGroup1 is clicked
  move Air_Lock_Door1 to y: -2 in 2 sec
  wait 5 sec
  move Air_Lock_Door1 to y: 0 in 2 sec
```

**Character Physics:**
```
when Regular_man is clicked
  push Regular_man with velocity 2 forward

when program starts
  set gravity pull to 0.17
```

**Start Programming:** Make your buttons control your doors and add physics to your characters!

### Slide 5: Mini Plenary
**Test Your Interactive Systems:**
- ‚úì Do your doors open and close when buttons are clicked?
- ‚úì Can you make characters jump or move when clicked?
- ‚úì Does the low gravity setting make objects behave differently?
- ‚úì Are your interactive systems responding consistently?
- ‚úì Do your doors close automatically after opening?

If your systems are working, you're ready for the challenge levels!

### Slide 6: Foundation Challenge (LA)
#### BASIC BUTTON-DOOR SYSTEM
**Your Mission:** Make your 1-dome base interactive with working systems

**What You Need to Program:**
- 1 button controls 1 door (open/close cycle)
- Characters respond to clicks with simple movement
- Set lunar gravity (0.17) for the entire base

**Success Looks Like:**
- Door opens when button is clicked, then closes automatically
- Characters move when you click them
- Everything feels lighter due to low gravity

**Perfect for:** Learning the basics of interactive programming!

### Slide 7: Intermediate Challenge (MA)
#### MULTIPLE INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS
**Your Mission:** Create independent control systems for your 2-dome complex

**What You Need to Program:**
- 2+ button-door pairs working separately
- Characters with different click responses (jumping, pushing)
- Different gravity in different areas
- Doors that give feedback (sounds or visual changes)

**Success Looks Like:**
- Multiple working systems that don't interfere with each other
- Varied character interactions throughout the base
- Different zones feel different to move through

**Perfect for:** Managing multiple systems at once!

### Slide 8: Advanced Challenge (HA)
#### COMPLEX BASE OPERATIONS
**Your Mission:** Create sophisticated control systems for your 3-dome network

**What You Need to Program:**
- Multiple gravity zones (different gravity in each dome)
- Emergency systems (all doors open at once)
- Advanced character behaviors affected by interactions
- Physics-based puzzles using gravity to move objects
- Complex timing sequences

**Success Looks Like:**
- Professional-level interaction design
- Creative problem-solving with physics
- Systems that work together seamlessly

**Perfect for:** Pushing programming skills to the limit!

### Slide 9: Plenary
**WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED TODAY:**
- ü§ñ Programmed interactive systems that respond to user input
- ‚öñÔ∏è Simulated realistic space physics and gravity
- üö™ Created working airlock systems like real space stations
- üéÆ Built responsive user interfaces

**KEY LEARNING:** Your bases now work like real space systems! You've learned how cause-and-effect programming makes technology respond to human actions. You're thinking like real space engineers!

### Slide 10: Next Steps
**YOU'RE READY FOR LESSON 3!**

**What's Coming Next:**
- üìã Add information panels that teach about space science
- ‚ùì Create quiz systems to test space knowledge
- üìπ Design educational tours using camera movement
- üéì Transform your base into a teaching tool for others

**Your Challenge:** Your interactive base will become an educational experience that teaches others about space exploration!

**Excellent Programming, Space Engineers!**
