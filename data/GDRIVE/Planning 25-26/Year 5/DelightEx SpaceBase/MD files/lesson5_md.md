# LUNAR BASE RECONSTRUCTION
## Lesson 3: Educational Information Systems
**Year 5 - Age 10**

### Slide 1: Lesson Title
**LUNAR BASE RECONSTRUCTION**  
Lesson 3: Educational Information Systems  
Year 5 - Age 10

### Slide 2: Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Create information panels that explain how your base works
- Design quiz systems that test space exploration knowledge
- Build educational tours using camera movement and timing
- Add text displays that teach real space science
- Transform your interactive base into a teaching tool for others

**Key Skills:** Information design, educational content, user experience, knowledge sharing

### Slide 3: Input - Teacher Shows Example
Watch this educational base in action: [Teacher demonstrates clicking domes to show info panels]

**See How:**
- Clicking domes shows information about their purpose
- Quiz questions test space knowledge with helpful feedback
- Camera moves to show different areas during tours
- Real space science facts are included

**Building on Your Interactive Base:** Your working doors and character systems from Lesson 2 provide perfect opportunities for educational content!

### Slide 4: Core Task - All Students Start Programming
**Essential Code Blocks to Use:**

**Information Panel System:**
```
when Dome_1 is clicked
  show info panel with title "Habitat Dome" 
  text "Living quarters with life support systems. Gravity set to 0.17g"
```

**Quiz System:**
```
when Space_Hanger is clicked
  show quiz panel with question "Why do lunar bases need airlocks?"
  correct answer "To prevent air loss"
  when correct: say "Correct! Air would escape into the vacuum of space"
  when incorrect: say "Think about what happens to air in space..."
```

**Start Programming:** Add educational content to teach others about your base!

### Slide 5: Mini Plenary
**Test Your Educational Systems:**
- ‚úì Do your information panels provide useful facts about space exploration?
- ‚úì Are your quiz questions appropriate for teaching others?
- ‚úì Can users easily navigate and learn from your base?
- ‚úì Does your educational content connect to real space science?
- ‚úì Are your explanations clear and accurate?

If people can learn from your base, you're ready for the challenge levels!

### Slide 6: Foundation Challenge (LA)
#### BASIC INFORMATION SYSTEM
**Your Mission:** Make your 1-dome base teach others about space living

**What You Need to Create:**
- 2-3 information panels explaining your dome and airlock
- 1 simple quiz question about lunar gravity or space
- Clear, accurate information that your classmates can understand

**Success Looks Like:**
- Working info panels that appear when clicked
- Educational content that teaches real space facts
- Quiz with helpful feedback for wrong answers

**Perfect for:** Creating your first educational content!

### Slide 7: Intermediate Challenge (MA)
#### COMPREHENSIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCE
**Your Mission:** Create a rich educational experience for your 2-dome complex

**What You Need to Create:**
- 4+ detailed information panels covering different space topics
- 2-3 quiz questions with helpful feedback
- Guided introduction sequence for new users
- Mix of base-specific and general space science information

**Success Looks Like:**
- Rich educational content throughout the base
- Good user guidance for visitors
- Combination of facts about your base and real space science

**Perfect for:** Building comprehensive learning experiences!

### Slide 8: Advanced Challenge (HA)
#### INTERACTIVE SPACE EDUCATION CENTER
**Your Mission:** Transform your 3-dome network into a professional educational experience

**What You Need to Create:**
- 6+ information systems covering complex space science topics
- Multi-question quiz system with scoring
- Multiple tour modes (construction, daily life, science, emergency)
- Interactive experiments (gravity comparisons, airlock demonstrations)
- Guided tours with different camera angles

**Success Looks Like:**
- Professional educational quality
- Innovative teaching methods
- Multiple ways to explore and learn

**Perfect for:** Creating museum-quality educational experiences!

### Slide 9: Plenary
**WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED TODAY:**
- üéì Created complete educational experiences about space exploration
- üìö Combined construction, programming, and teaching skills
- üöÄ Built learning tools that teach real space science
- üë®‚Äçüè´ Became educators who can teach others

**KEY LEARNING:** You've taken basic building components and created sophisticated learning environments that could actually help train future astronauts! You're now space education experts!

### Slide 10: Next Steps
**PROJECT COMPLETE - WELL DONE!**

**What You've Mastered:**
- üèóÔ∏è **Construction Skills:** Logical base design using modular components
- ü§ñ **Programming Skills:** Interactive systems with buttons, doors, and physics
- üéì **Educational Design:** Information systems that teach real space science

**Real-World Connections:**
- Your airlock systems work like those on the International Space Station
- Your gravity settings match actual lunar conditions (1/6th Earth gravity)
- Your modular base design reflects real space habitat planning

**You've become Space Engineers, Programmers, AND Educators!**
