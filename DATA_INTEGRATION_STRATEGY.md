# PTCC Data Integration Strategy

This document outlines the approach for integrating live school data into the PTCC (Personal Teaching Command Center) system, from initial assessment through full automation.

## Overview

PTCC is designed to be **integration-agnostic** - the FastAPI backend can accept data from any source and process it through the ChromaDB RAG system. The integration complexity depends entirely on the school's existing technology infrastructure.

## Integration Difficulty Assessment

### Level 1: API-Ready Systems ‚≠ê (Days to Weeks)

**Characteristics:**
- Modern cloud-based systems
- Well-documented REST APIs
- OAuth or API key authentication
- JSON response formats

**Examples:**
- **Student Information Systems**: PowerSchool, Clever, ClassLink, Infinite Campus
- **Learning Management**: Google Classroom, Canvas, Schoology
- **Communication**: ParentSquare, Remind, Seesaw
- **Assessment**: Khan Academy, IXL, Renaissance

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example API client structure
class SchoolSystemAPI:
    def __init__(self, api_key, base_url):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = base_url
    
    def fetch_students(self):
        # HTTP GET to /api/students
        pass
    
    def fetch_attendance(self, date_range):
        # HTTP GET to /api/attendance
        pass
```

**Benefits:**

## RAG System Data Flow

All integration methods feed into the same RAG pipeline:

```
Raw Data Source ‚Üí Data Processing ‚Üí Embedding Generation ‚Üí ChromaDB Storage ‚Üí RAG Queries
     ‚Üì                   ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                   ‚Üì              ‚Üì
[API/File/DB] ‚Üí [Clean/Transform] ‚Üí [Text Embeddings] ‚Üí [Vector Store] ‚Üí [AI Analysis]
```

### Embedding Requirements

**For every new data source:**
1. **Text Extraction**: Convert structured data to searchable text
2. **Chunking**: Break large documents into manageable pieces
3. **Embedding**: Generate vector representations using ChromaDB
4. **Indexing**: Store for fast semantic search

**Example Processing Pipeline:**
```python
class DataEmbeddingPipeline:
    def __init__(self, chroma_client):
        self.chroma = chroma_client
    
    def process_student_record(self, student_data):
        # Convert structured data to searchable text
        text_representation = self.create_searchable_text(student_data)
        
        # Generate embeddings
        embedding = self.chroma.embed([text_representation])
        
        # Store in vector database
        self.chroma.add(
            documents=[text_representation],
            embeddings=embedding,
            ids=[f"student_{student_data['id']}"],
            metadatas=[{"type": "student_record", "timestamp": datetime.now()}]
        )
```
