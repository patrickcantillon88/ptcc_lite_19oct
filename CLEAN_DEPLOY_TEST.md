# Clean Deployment Test

If Render keeps failing, create a new test repository:

## Steps:

1. **Create new GitHub repository**: `ptcc-test`

2. **Add only these files**:
   ```
   main.py
   requirements.txt
   ```

3. **requirements.txt content**:
   ```
   streamlit
   ```

4. **main.py content**:
   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   
   st.title("🏫 PTCC Test")
   st.success("✅ Deployment works!")
   st.write("This proves the basic deployment is working.")
   ```

5. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**: 
   - Go to share.streamlit.io
   - Connect the new `ptcc-test` repository
   - Deploy with `main.py` as entry point

6. **Once working**, gradually add features back:
   - Authentication
   - FastAPI backend  
   - Database functionality
   - Full PTCC features

This isolates the deployment issue from your main codebase complexity.
