## Next Session (N+1) - AI Integration & Features

### Priority 1: Enable Gemini API Integration (3-4 hours)

**Goal:** Unlock AI-powered features

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Configure GEMINI_API_KEY in .env
   ```bash
   # Get key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here' >> .env
   ```

2. [ ] Verify LLM integration works
   ```bash
   python3 << 'EOF'
   from backend.core.llm_integration import LLMIntegration
   llm = LLMIntegration()
   response = llm.generate("Test prompt", provider="gemini")
   print(response)
   EOF
   ```

3. [ ] Test AI agent endpoints
   - [ ] `/api/agents/at-risk` - Identify struggling students
   - [ ] `/api/agents/behavior` - Behavior pattern analysis
   - [ ] `/api/agents/learning-paths` - Personalized suggestions

4. [ ] Enable briefing AI features
   - [ ] Test `/api/briefing/today` with AI context
   - [ ] Verify chat responses are intelligent (not fallback)

**Expected Outcome:** Chat shows real AI responses, agents provide insights

---

### Priority 2: Complete Document Ingestion Pipeline (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Make RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) fully functional

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Fix PDF processing
   - Ensure PyPDF2 properly installed and working
   - Test with Mock School Dataset PDF

2. [ ] Verify document upload endpoint
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/documents/upload \
     -F "file=@sample.pdf" \
     -F "doc_type=briefing"
   ```

3. [ ] Test semantic search
   - Upload 3-5 documents
   - Search for content
   - Verify relevance scores >0.5

4. [ ] Enable document search in chat
   - Update briefing_engine to use RAG
   - Verify citations appear in responses

**Expected Outcome:** Users can upload documents and search them semantically

---

### Priority 3: Mobile PWA Integration (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Test React frontend connectivity

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Start mobile PWA
   ```bash
   cd frontend/mobile-pwa && npm run dev
   # Should be on port 5174
   ```

2. [ ] Test API connectivity
   - [ ] Load student list
   - [ ] Display individual student
   - [ ] Test quick-logging functionality

3. [ ] Test offline functionality
   - [ ] Verify service worker registered
   - [ ] Test cached data display when offline
   - [ ] Test sync when back online

4. [ ] Verify responsive design
   - [ ] Test on actual mobile device (if available)
   - [ ] Test on browser mobile emulation (F12 → Device Toggle)

**Expected Outcome:** Mobile interface works and logs sync with backend

---

- DECISION: Fix empty list handling instead of requiring data
- DECISION: Prioritize AI integration over mobile PWA

**Session N+1 (To Do):**
- DECISION: Use Gemini API or wait for OpenAI credits?
- DECISION: Implement auth now or delay to Month 2?
