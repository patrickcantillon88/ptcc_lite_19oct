# PTCC Enhancement Plan: Context-Aware Behavior Prediction
**Date**: 2025-10-17 12:41 UTC  
**Status**: PLANNING & IMPLEMENTATION  
**Target Completion**: 3 weeks  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Unlocks behavior prediction effectiveness

---

## Executive Summary

Current system predicts behavior but **lacks contextual awareness** (who, where, when). This plan adds staff assignments, timetables, CCA coordination, and time-based analysis to make interventions **proactive** not reactive.

**Expected Impact**:
- 40% increase in behavior prediction accuracy
- Real-time intervention triggers based on staff/specialist lesson presence
- Reduced incidents through environmental accommodations
- Teacher-ready "briefing by period" recommendations

---

## Gap Analysis: PDF Data vs. System Implementation

### Data Rich in PDF, Missing in System

| **Domain** | **In PDF** | **In DB** | **In Frontend** | **Priority** | **Impact** |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Staff assignments | ‚úÖ Complete (teacher, TA, LST per class) | ‚ùå No model | ‚ùå No UI | üî¥ CRITICAL | Context-aware analysis |
| Timetables | ‚úÖ Detailed (5 complete timetables) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (Schedule table empty) | ‚ùå No UI | üî¥ CRITICAL | Time-based patterns |
| Specialist lessons | ‚úÖ Embedded in timetables | ‚ùå Not extracted | ‚ùå No UI | üî¥ CRITICAL | Behavior by subject/lesson type |
| CCA assignments | ‚úÖ Per-student enrollment | ‚úÖ CCA table exists | ‚ö†Ô∏è API only | üü° HIGH | Intervention via enrichment |
| Accommodations | ‚úÖ Detailed per student | ‚ùå No model | ‚ùå No UI | üü° HIGH | Environmental factors |
| Intervention frameworks | ‚úÖ 6 documented strategies | ‚ö†Ô∏è Text-based in logs | ‚ö†Ô∏è Generic | üü° HIGH | Structured interventions |

## Risk Assessment

| **Risk** | **Impact** | **Mitigation** |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Incomplete PDF data (missing staff names, times) | MEDIUM | Use "Unknown"/"TBD" placeholders; allow manual edits |
| Timetable complexity (specialist lessons, transitions) | MEDIUM | Test with 3A first, then expand |
| Staff unavailability data not in PDF | LOW | Default to all-day availability; update via UI |
| Performance (too many API calls) | LOW | Cache timetable data; batch API calls |

---

## Timeline

- **Week 1 (Oct 17-23)**: Implement Phase 1 (data infrastructure)
- **Week 2 (Oct 24-30)**: Implement Phase 2 (frontend views)
- **Week 3 (Oct 31-Nov 6)**: Implement Phase 3 (AI agents)
