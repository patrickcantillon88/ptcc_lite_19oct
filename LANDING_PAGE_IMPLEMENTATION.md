## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Hero Section
- **Gradient background** with professional PTCC branding
- **Clear value proposition** for specialist teachers managing 400+ students
- **Compelling tagline:** "AI-Powered Information Management for Specialist Teachers"

### 3. Interactive RAG System Demonstration

**Visual Workflow (6-Step Process):**

**Setup Phase (Done Once):**
1. **📝 Encode Documents** - Text → Embedding Model → Vectors
2. **🗃️ Index & Store** - Vectors → ChromaDB → Searchable Index  
3. **⚡ Ready!** - Documents → Vectors → Searchable

**Query Phase (Every Search):**
4. **❓ Encode Query** - "Show me Sophie" → Vector
5. **🎯 Similarity Search** - Vector → Similar Documents
6. **🤖 Generate Response** - Context + Query → LLM → Response

### 4. Live RAG Demo
Interactive demonstration with 3 sample queries:
- **"Show me Sophie Chen's profile"** → Student data retrieval
- **"What's today's assembly time?"** → Schedule information  
- **"Students with recent incidents"** → Behavioral analysis

Each demo shows:
- Original query

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- **`/frontend/desktop-web/app.py`** - Main application file
  - Added `show_landing_page()` function (lines 179-307)
  - Added `show_rag_workflow_demo()` function (lines 309-433)
  - Updated main flow to show landing page first (line 540-542)

### Session State Management
- **New state variable:** `intro_viewed` 
- **Flow control:** Landing page shows until user clicks "Continue"
- **Seamless integration:** Existing privacy modal and main app unchanged

### Code Structure
```python
def show_landing_page():
    """Display PTCC introduction and RAG system demonstration"""
    if 'intro_viewed' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.intro_viewed = False
    
    if not st.session_state.intro_viewed:
        # [Landing page content]
        if st.button("🚀 Continue to PTCC Dashboard"):
            st.session_state.intro_viewed = True
            st.rerun()
        st.stop()  # Prevents further execution
```

### Styling Approach
- **HTML/CSS in Streamlit** - Custom styled components using `st.markdown()` with `unsafe_allow_html=True`
- **Color scheme:** Consistent with existing PTCC branding
- **Responsive design:** Works on desktop and tablet screens
- **Professional typography:** Clear hierarchy and readability
