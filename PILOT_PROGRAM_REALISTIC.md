# PTCC Pilot Program: 3-6 Teachers, Minimal Budget

## The Real Scenario
- **Teachers**: 3-6 specialist teachers
- **Students**: ~200-400 across their classes
- **Infrastructure**: School server (hosting data only)
- **API Access**: Google Workspace (already available)
- **Devices**: Teacher laptops + mobile for logging
- **Budget**: Near-zero (system cost), small admin time
- **Timeline**: 2-week setup, 8-week pilot

---

## What This System ACTUALLY Delivers (Realistic)

### 1. Smart Information Layer Over Google Workspace
**What it does:**
- Pulls data from Google Sheets (student lists, support notes)
- Syncs from Google Calendar (lesson schedules, meetings)
- Searches across Google Drive documents (policies, lesson plans)
- **Creates unified interface** - instead of checking 3 different places, one search

**Real example:**
```
Without PTCC:
"Show me students with anxiety support needs"
‚Üí Teacher checks Google Drive folder (4 minutes)
‚Üí Opens 3 different support plan PDFs
‚Üí Manually finds anxiety strategies section
‚Üí Total time: 8-10 minutes

With PTCC:
"Show me students with anxiety support needs"
‚Üí Search returns all matching students + strategies
‚Üí Total time: 10 seconds
```

**This works TODAY with minimal setup:**
- No special software installation needed (web-based)
- Google Sheets API already available
- Just needs API authentication (1 hour admin setup)

---

### 2. Quick Incident Logging During Lessons
**What it does:**
- Teachers log incidents on mobile (30-second workflow)
- Supports positive/negative/neutral with categories
- Works offline, syncs when connected
- Logs saved permanently to school server

**Real workflow:**
```
Monday Period 3:
Teacher notices Sarah showing anxiety
‚Üí Opens PTCC mobile app
‚Üí "Sarah" + "Anxious" + brief note
‚Üí Hit "Log" (10 seconds)
‚Üí Continue teaching

System automatically:
- Records to school database
- Counts toward Sarah's support tracking
- Makes searchable
```

**Time savings:**
- Old way: Mental note, remember later, maybe write down
- New way: Instant logged, automatically tracked
- **Gain**: Always have complete incident history (vs patchy memory)

---

### 3. Unified Student Profile View
**What it does:**
- Shows all logged incidents for any student
- Pulls existing support notes from Google Drive
- Calendar integration (shows lesson times, meetings)
- All in one searchable interface

**Real benefit:**
```
Teacher meeting with parent about Jamie:

Without PTCC:
"Let me check... I think Jamie has had 3 incidents"
‚Üí Takes time to gather notes
‚Üí May miss some details
‚Üí Parent goes home uncertain

With PTCC:
"Let me show you what we've tracked..."
‚Üí Pull up Jamie's profile
‚Üí Show exact dates, incidents, patterns
‚Üí "Last incident was Tuesday when tired"
‚Üí Parent sees systematic approach
```

---

### 4. Search Across All Documents
**What it does:**
- Teachers can search: "What anxiety strategies have we tried with Sarah?"
- Searches uploaded support plans, policies, meeting notes
- Works across all documents in project
- Returns exact locations with context

**Real use:**
```
Teacher preparing differentiation for ADHD student:
"Show me successful strategies from previous lessons"
‚Üí Searches all lesson notes, support plans
‚Üí Finds: "Movement breaks every 15 mins worked well"
‚Üí Immediately useful for next lesson
```

---

### 5. Pattern Identification (Simple)
**What it does:**
- System counts incidents by student
- Flags if one student suddenly increases incidents
- Shows patterns: "Sarah often has incidents Monday mornings"
- No ML required - just counting + trending

**Real alerts:**
```
System notices:
"Jamie has 4 incidents in last 2 days (unusual)"
‚Üí Alert sent to teacher
‚Üí Teacher can intervene early
‚Üí Parent can be involved

Vs old way:
‚Üí Teacher might not notice pattern until crisis
‚Üí No early intervention
```

---

## What You DON'T Get (Don't Need)

‚ùå AI agents making predictions  
‚ùå Machine learning models  
‚ùå Predictive risk scoring  
‚ùå Complex analytics dashboards  
‚ùå Expensive integrations  

**These are nice-to-haves AFTER pilot proves value.**

**What happens:**
- Each teacher gets 1 hour training
- They start using search feature (instant win - faster than Google manually)
- Mobile logging introduced
- Real data from Google Sheets appears in PTCC

**Teacher reaction:**
"Oh, so it's just... everything I'm already using but faster?"
"Yeah, basically."

---

### Week 4-5: Active Logging Begins
**What happens:**
- Teachers start logging incidents daily
- Mobile app usage increases
- First patterns emerge
- Students get profile views updated real-time

**Real benefit:**
- After 2 weeks, each teacher has 20-30 logged incidents
- Search becomes genuinely useful ("find all incidents for Sarah")
- Mobile logging becomes habit (easy workflow)

---

### Week 6-8: Pattern Recognition
**What happens:**
- System has 200-300 logged incidents across 3-6 teachers
- Patterns start showing
- "Sarah always struggles Monday mornings"
- "Jamie's incidents spike after PE"
- "Marcus improves after one-to-one check-ins"

**Real value:**
- Teachers see patterns they didn't notice before
- Can make informed decisions ("avoid assigning anxiety trigger tasks Monday morning")
- Parent meetings have data to show ("We've noticed X pattern, trying Y strategy")

## Honest What-You-Achieve List

### ‚úÖ Definitely Achievable in Pilot
- **Unified search** across Google Workspace (saves 5-10 mins per search)
- **Incident logging** (automatic permanent record vs patchy notes)
- **Student profile view** (see all info in one place)
- **Pattern detection** (simple: "Marcus has 5 incidents, Sarah has 2")
- **Mobile logging** (30-second workflow becomes habit)
- **Data export** (show parents/leadership all tracked incidents)
- **Compliance** (complete audit trail for safeguarding)

### üü° Partially Achievable (Basic Versions)
- **Risk flagging** (simple: "5+ incidents in a week = flag", no ML)
- **Trend analysis** (show graphs: incidents over time)
- **Comparative reporting** ("This week vs last week")
