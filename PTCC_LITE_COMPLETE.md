# ✅ PTCC LITE V1 - COMPLETE\n\n**Build Date**: October 19, 2025  \n**Status**: Ready for Production Use  \n**Repository**: https://github.com/patrickcantillon88/ptcc_lite_19oct\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What You Now Have\n\nA focused, lightweight system for managing YOUR ICT classes. No bloat. No complexity. Just incident logging + student memory + patterns.\n\n### ✅ What's Built\n\n#### Backend API (`backend/api/lite_endpoints.py`)\n- **GET /api/lite/classes** - List YOUR ICT classes\n- **GET /api/lite/class/{class_code}** - Full roster with CAT4, EAL/LS flags, latest assessment, incident count\n- **POST /api/lite/incident** - Log incident in <10 seconds\n- **GET /api/lite/incidents** - Filter by student, class, time period\n- **GET /api/lite/patterns/weekly** - See incident trends\n- **GET /api/lite/briefing/{class_code}** - Pre-lesson briefing with at-risk & high performers\n- **GET /api/lite/health** - System status\n\n#### Data Import (`scripts/import_lite_data.py`)\n- ✅ CAT4 data (720 students → filtered to YOUR ICT classes)\n- ✅ Class rosters with names, forms, EAL/LS flags\n- ✅ ICT timetable\n- ✅ Quizziz data (10 quiz files)\n\n**Why filtered**: Only your students matter. 1-tap class selection in UI, no cognitive overhead.\n\n#### Web UI (`frontend/ptcc-lite.html`)\nSingle-file, standalone, no dependencies needed:\n\n1. **👥 Class Roster** - See all students with ability, support needs, assessments, incidents\n2. **📝 Incident Logger** - Select class → student → type → category → log (30 seconds)\n3. **📊 Weekly Patterns** - Incident trends sorted by volume\n4. **📋 Pre-Lesson Briefing** - At-risk students, high performers, active this week\n\n#### Integration (`backend/main.py`)\n- Lite endpoints registered and active\n- CORS configured for localhost\n- API health check working\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 How to Start TODAY\n\n### Step 1: Import Data (2 minutes)\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/cantillonpatrick/Desktop/ptcc_lite_19oct\npython scripts/import_lite_data.py\n```\n\nYou'll see:\n```\n🚀 PTCC LITE DATA IMPORT\n📚 Importing CAT4 data (YOUR ICT classes only)...\n📋 Importing class roster...\n⏰ Importing ICT timetable...\n📊 Importing Quizziz data...\n✅ Data import complete!\n```\n\n**Important**: Check your class codes first. Edit line 43 in `import_lite_data.py`:\n\n```python\nreturn ['3A', '3C', '4A', '4B', '5A', '5B', '6A', '6C']  # YOUR classes\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start Backend (1 minute)\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/cantillonpatrick/Desktop/ptcc_lite_19oct\npython -m backend.main\n```\n\nYou should see:\n```\nINFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8001\n```\n\n### Step 3: Open the UI (10 seconds)\n\nOpen in your browser:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8001/api/lite/health\n```\n\nOr manually:\n```bash\nopen /Users/cantillonpatrick/Desktop/ptcc_lite_19oct/frontend/ptcc-lite.html\n```\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Real Usage Workflow\n\n### Before First Lesson (Monday Morning)\n\n1. Open PTCC Lite\n2. Click \"Pre-Lesson Briefing\"\n3. Select class (e.g., \"3A\")\n4. See: Who's at-risk? Who's excelling? Who was active last week?\n5. Takes 30 seconds → You have context for the lesson\n\n### During Lesson\n\n1. Click \"Incident Logger\"\n2. Select class and student\n3. Log: Positive/Negative/Neutral + Category + optional note\n4. Takes 10 seconds per incident\n5. Do this for 3-5 key moments\n\n### After Lesson\n\n1. Click \"Weekly Patterns\"\n2. See: Who disrupted 4x this week? Who collaborated well?\n3. Use for next lesson planning\n\n### Friday Afternoon\n\n1. Review all patterns for the week\n2. System has memory of everything\n3. Next week you'll have two weeks of data\n\n---\n\n## 📊 What Data You Have Access To\n\n### Students (720 total, filtered to YOUR classes)\n\n```\nName, Year Group, Class, House\nCAT4 Scores: Verbal, Quantitative, Non-Verbal, Spatial, Mean\nFlags: Learning Support (LS), EAL (with tier)\nLatest Assessment: Topic, Score %, Date\nThis Week's Incidents: Count\n```\n\n### Incidents (You create these)\n\n```\nStudent, Class, Timestamp, Type (Positive/Negative/Neutral)\nCategory: Excellent Contribution, Off Task, Disruption, Good Collaboration, Helping Peer\nOptional Note: \"Disrupted whole group with off-topic questions\"\nPoints: House points awarded/deducted\n```\n\n### System Memory\n\n```\nWeekly Patterns: Which students had most incidents, breakdown by type\nTrends: Concerning (>50% negative) or Stable (<=50% negative)\nBriefing: At-risk (2+ negative incidents), High Performers (85%+ quiz)\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Customization\n\n### Your ICT Classes\n\nEdit `scripts/import_lite_data.py` line 40-43:\n\n```python\ndef get_your_ict_classes():\n    return ['3A', '3C', '4A', '4B', '5A', '5B', '6A', '6C']  # YOUR classes\n```\n\nRun import again after editing.\n\n### API Port\n\nIf port 8001 is busy, edit `backend/main.py` (bottom of file) or set env var:\n\n```bash\nPORT=8002 python -m backend.main\n```\n\n### Incident Categories\n\nEdit `frontend/ptcc-lite.html` line ~385:\n\n```html\n<option value=\"excellent_contribution\">Excellent Contribution</option>\n<option value=\"off_task\">Off Task</option>\n<!-- Add your own categories here -->\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🐛 Troubleshooting\n\n### \"No classes showing\"\n- Check class codes in `get_your_ict_classes()`\n- Verify timetable has your class names\n- Re-run import after fixing\n\n### \"Cannot connect to API\"\n- Is backend running? Check terminal\n- Is port 8001 free? Try `lsof -i :8001`\n- Try different port: `PORT=8002 python -m backend.main`\n\n### \"Data import fails\"\n- Check file paths exist:\n  - `/Users/cantillonpatrick/Downloads/data (1).xlsx`\n  - `/Users/cantillonpatrick/Desktop/ptcc_lite_19oct/data/GDRIVE/...`\n- Check file permissions: `chmod 644 data/*.xlsx`\n- Delete database and retry: `rm data/school.db && python scripts/import_lite_data.py`\n\n---\n\n## 📁 File Structure\n\n```\nptcc_lite_19oct/\n├── backend/\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   └── lite_endpoints.py          # Core API (6 endpoints)\n│   ├── models/\n│   │   └── database_models.py        # Student, QuickLog, Assessment\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   └── database.py               # SQLite setup\n│   └── main.py                        # FastAPI app (lite_router included)\n├── frontend/\n│   └── ptcc-lite.html                # Single-file web UI\n├── scripts/\n│   └── import_lite_data.py            # Data import (YOUR classes only)\n├── data/\n│   └── school.db                      # SQLite database\n├── PTCC_LITE_QUICKSTART.md            # Quick start guide\n└── PTCC_LITE_COMPLETE.md              # This file\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Next Steps (After Tomorrow's Lesson)\n\n### Review Data\n1. Did you log incidents?\n2. Do patterns match what you observed?\n3. Was the UI fast enough?\n\n### Iterate\n1. Add categories that fit your classroom\n2. Adjust at-risk threshold (currently 2+ negative)\n3. Fine-tune \"high performer\" threshold (currently 85%)\n\n### Extend (After 1 week)\n1. Add student photos (if available)\n2. Export weekly reports\n3. Integrate with Google Sheets\n4. Add more data sources (assessment, behavior)\n\n---\n\n## 🎓 Real Impact (What This Solves)\n\n### Before PTCC Lite\n- \"Who was disrupting last lesson?\" → Manual search or guess\n- \"Who's struggling?\" → Check three different systems\n- \"What strategies work for this student?\" → Not documented\n- Monday morning → \"Wait, what was happening with 3A last week?\"\n\n### With PTCC Lite\n- \"Who was disrupting last lesson?\" → Click pattern view, 5 seconds\n- \"Who's struggling?\" → Pre-lesson briefing shows at-risk students\n- \"What strategies worked?\" → See which positive incidents led to what\n- Monday morning → 2 weeks of data showing real trends\n\n---\n\n## 📞 Commands Quick Reference\n\n```bash\n# Import data\npython scripts/import_lite_data.py\n\n# Start backend\npython -m backend.main\n\n# Open UI (manual)\nopen frontend/ptcc-lite.html\n\n# Check API health\ncurl http://localhost:8001/api/lite/health\n\n# View API docs\nopen http://localhost:8001/docs\n\n# Clear database and start fresh\nrm data/school.db\npython scripts/import_lite_data.py\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✨ You're Ready\n\nEverything is built. Everything is tested. Everything works.\n\n**Tomorrow**:\n1. Import data (2 mins)\n2. Start backend (30 secs)\n3. Open UI (10 secs)\n4. Log incidents during Y6 lesson\n5. See patterns after lesson\n\nThat's it. The system will give you back more time than you spent setting it up.\n\n---\n\n**GitHub**: https://github.com/patrickcantillon88/ptcc_lite_19oct  \n**Status**: Production Ready ✅  \n**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025\n"
